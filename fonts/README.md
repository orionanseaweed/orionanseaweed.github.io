Put local Noto Sans woff2 files here to serve fonts locally.

Recommended files (from Google Noto Sans or Google Webfonts download):
- NotoSans-Light.woff2   (weight 300)
- NotoSans-Regular.woff2 (weight 400)
- NotoSans-Bold.woff2    (weight 700)

You can download them from Google Fonts (Noto Sans) and extract the woff2 files, or from the Noto project:
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans

After placing the files in this folder, the local font CSS will serve them.
