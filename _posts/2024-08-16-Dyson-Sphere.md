Even a normal kid or anyone just once watching the Marvel series or Star Wars can imagine a perspective outside our planet in that immensity universe.Exoplanet citizens with a big head? Numerous spaceships that contain a whole country, wander between stars? Or the parent planet with many skyscraper buildings, everywhere are robotics and automatication?

The realm of imagination is a wonderland, but that is also where most of us stopped—we have reached our limitations—we can't prove it. Freeman Dyson is in the minority, and his unique arguments that are provided in an article, "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation", impressed me greatly. It's not only a normal report with some "strange" thoughts, but also an inner voice that I, us, want to share with the world.

> Abstract: If extraterrestrial intelligent beings exist and have reached a high level of technical development, one by-product of their energy metabolism is likely to be the large-scale conversion of starlight into far-infrared radiation. It is proposed that a search for sources of infrared radiation should accompany the recently initiated search for interstellar radio communications.

As Dyson mentioned in his report, Malthus principles talk about the growth of population, which is increasing at a potentially exponential rate, while resources and energy are only increasing in an arithmetic progression.

It's led to the Malthusian catastrophe: famine and war, resulting in poverty and depopulation. Dyson pointed out that

<ul>
    <li>
        If a civilization grows at 1% per year, it only takes about 3,000 years to grow by a factor of 10<sup>12</sup>.
    </li>

    <li>
        The material resources being exploited by humans are limited to Earth's biosphere ~ 5.10<sup>19</sup> grams.
        The present energy supply may be estimated at 10<sup>20</sup> ergs/sec, so after ~3,000 years, this civilization will run out of energy for development.
    </li>
</ul>

But outside there: Jupiter contains about 2.10<sup>30</sup> grams of available mass, and the total rate of energy output of the Sun is 4.10<sup>33</sup> ergs/sec. It is not infinite, but it is huge for us to survive, so how can we exploit it?

The same toughness might likely be questioned for any similar civilization. The idea of the development of a large shell that could entirely surround the star of that civilization is born; that shell's mission is to absorb energy emitted from the stars and allow the beings to use that energy. And it's known as the Dyson Sphere.
